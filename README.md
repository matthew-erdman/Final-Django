Final commit: 9f732be

**Current test accounts:**
1. [su] admin / admin
2. bob / password
3. chad / ********
4. dave / hunter2
5. eric / bruh13579

**\+ 30%:**
> Using template extensions.

Navbar, included in every page from header.html.

> Allowing for a new user to register through a form.

Register page, new users can register through the form.

> Give users ability to edit existing data in the database.

Edit page, users and admins can edit existing posts.

> More complex use of permissions/logins/logouts, where, for example, some users can edit/add data and some can't.

Permissions checking on the edit page only allows the admin or OP to edit a post.

> Filtering/sorting data that you pull from the database.

User page, only displays posts by the logged-in user.
